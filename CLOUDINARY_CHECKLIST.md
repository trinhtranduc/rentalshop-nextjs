## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cloudinary not configured"
**Check:**
- [ ] All 3 Cloudinary env vars added to Railway API service
- [ ] No typos in env var names
- [ ] No extra spaces in env var values
- [ ] Railway redeployed after adding env vars

**Fix:**
```bash
# Railway ‚Üí API Service ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí Check:
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name  ‚úÖ No quotes
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345     ‚úÖ No quotes  
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abc123xyz        ‚úÖ No quotes
```

### Issue: "Upload failed"
**Check:**
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` set in Client/Admin service
- [ ] API URL is correct (no trailing slash)
- [ ] User is authenticated (has token)
- [ ] File size < 5MB
- [ ] File type is allowed (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check in browser console:
console.log('API URL:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL);
// Should show: https://apis-development.up.railway.app

// Check network tab:
// Should see POST to: https://apis-development.up.railway.app/api/upload/image
```

### Issue: "Invalid signature"
**Check:**
- [ ] API Secret copied correctly (click üëÅÔ∏è to reveal full secret)
- [ ] No extra spaces or line breaks in secret

**Fix:**
1. Go to Cloudinary Dashboard
2. Copy API Secret again (full string)
3. Update `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` on Railway
4. Redeploy API service

### Issue: Images not loading after upload
**Check:**
- [ ] Image URL in response (check network tab)
- [ ] If Cloudinary URL ‚Üí CORS issue?
- [ ] If local URL ‚Üí file permissions?
- [ ] If base64 URL ‚Üí fallback mode (check Cloudinary config)

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check Railway API logs:
railway logs --service api

# Look for:
‚úÖ Image uploaded to Cloudinary  # Success
‚ö†Ô∏è Cloudinary not configured     # Missing env vars
‚ö†Ô∏è Using base64 fallback         # Upload failed
```

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Cloudinary Dashboard
- [ ] Monitor storage usage: https://console.cloudinary.com/
- [ ] Check bandwidth usage (25GB free/month)
- [ ] Review transformations count (25K free/month)
- [ ] Set up usage alerts (optional)

### Railway Logs
```bash
# View API logs:
railway logs --service api

# Look for:
‚úÖ Image uploaded to Cloudinary
‚ö†Ô∏è Cloudinary upload failed, falling back to local storage
‚ùå Upload error: ...
```
